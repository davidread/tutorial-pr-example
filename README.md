# Tutorial PR Templates

This repository contains Markdown template files for creating a Tutorial PRâ€”a pull request format augmented with walkthrough comments to help other devs into the changes implemented. This format is useful for explaining large changesets, implementation of new frameworks or libraries, breaking changes, and more!

Check out [the original article](https://medium.com/skillshare-team/tutorial-prs-using-pull-requests-for-effective-on-boarding-e1b38a63d68f) that from which this format derived from.
